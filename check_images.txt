Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: all three model architectures were able to identify the breed of the dog (labrador retriever).


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: None of the models were able to identify the breed of the dog Dog_02 to be the same as dog Dog_01. 
However, the ResNet and VGG models were able to identify that it is a dog. The AlexNet model did not identify it as a dog.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: All three models were able to correctly classify Raccoon_01.jpg and Computer_keyboard_01.jpg to not be dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: The ResNet and VGG models were both able to correctly classify the two dog images and to identify the breed for the Labrador_retriever_01.jpg which makes both valid choices.
However, VGG is the better choice because it delivered better results on the original pet_images.
Note that VGG was also able to identify the Computer_keyboard.jpg even if this is not relevant to the goal of the project.
